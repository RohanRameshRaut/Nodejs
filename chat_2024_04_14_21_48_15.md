1. **You**: write a hello world program
2. **ChatGPT**: Here is a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

When you run this code, it will output "Hello, World!" to the console. This program simply uses the `print()` function in Python to display the text "Hello, World!". It is often used as a first program when learning a new programming language as a way to verify that the setup is correct and the code is running correctly.
